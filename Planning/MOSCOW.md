#### MUST (MVP)

* Allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants

* Allow the user to create, edit and delete spending categories, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport

* Allow assignment of categories, merchants and amount to a transaction,

* Display all the transactions in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.


#### SHOULD (extensions)

* Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.

* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.

* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.

#### COULD

* Allow multiple users?

* Anything else I can think of (time permitting)


#### WON'T
