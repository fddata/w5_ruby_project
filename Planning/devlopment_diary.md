**2018_08_10 - Friday**

AM: Planning for Money Tracker, creating UX files (profiles, needs, MOSCOW and journeys).  Some simple layout sketches (freehand on paper, will add finalised .xmls at end).

PM: DB and Class diagrams, spent afternoon/evening creating the sql file and getting as far as I could on CRUD methods for my 4 classes.

Unsure if I will use the User class at the moment... but it seems to be the easiest way to incorporate the Budget feature I would like to add.

Mood: slightly worried I won't have enough time to do everything _and_ make the app look nice! Still optimistic though.

Added views for transactions, merchants and categories.  Added a view of all transactions and discovered the in-built @transactions.sum(&:amount) method.
