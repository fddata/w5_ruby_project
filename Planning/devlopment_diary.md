AM: Planning for Money Tracker, creating UX files (profiles, needs, MOSCOW and journeys).  Some simple layout sketches (freehand on paper, will add finalised .xmls at end).

PM: DB and Class diagrams, spent afternoon/evening creating the sql file and getting as far as I could on CRUD methods for my 4 classes.

Unsure if I will use the User class at the moment... but it seems to be the easiest way to incorporate the Budget feature I would like to add.

Mood: slightly worried I won't have enough time to do everything _and_ make the app look nice! Still optimistic though.

Added views for transactions, merchants and categories.  Added a view of all transactions and discovered the in-built @transactions.sum(&:amount) method.

AM:  Worked towards MVP.  Took surprisingly long to do all of the new, create, edit, update and  delete methods for each of the 3 classes!

PM:  Reached MVP, then discovered it is much tidier to have separate controller files for each of the classes and run it all from a central app.rb file.  Went back in to tidy it up, my controllers and views folder are _much_  easier to read now!
